# Time tracking dashboard with Tailwind CSS

This is a practice project to create a time tracking dashboard.
The purpose is to practice Tailwind CSS setup and organization of project directories
in a professional manner.


## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (version 14 or later)
- **npm** (or yarn)
- A text editor (e.g., VS Code)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Run the following command to install all required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run Tailwind CSS build:**

   Use the following command to process the CSS:

   ```bash
   npm run watch
   ```

4. **Preview your card:**

   Open `public/index.html` in your browser to see the dashboard styled with Tailwind CSS.

## Collaboration Guidelines

To maintain a clean and professional workflow, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build the project locally:**

   Run the following command to generate the `dist/` folder:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Make your changes:**

   Edit files in the `src/` directory as needed. Do **not** modify files in the `dist/` directory directly, as they are auto-generated.

## Notes

- **`node_modules` and `dist/` directories are excluded from version control** to keep the repository lightweight and clean.
- Always run `npm run build` after making changes to ensure your styles are up-to-date.
